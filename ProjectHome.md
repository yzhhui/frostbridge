Frostbridge is a flexible XML data binding library written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/).  Frostbridge converts data to and from XML based on user defined patterns.  These patterns are inspired by and are similar in expressiveness to [RelaxNG](http://relaxng.org).

An initial, early release is available in the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/frostbridge/downloads/list) section.  See the [About](About.md) page for an overview and the SitemapExample page to get started.  Additionally, the project source code may be checked out (see the [Source](http://code.google.com/p/frostbridge/source/browse/) page).  You can browse the [scaladocs online](http://frostbridge.googlecode.com/svn/tags/0.2.1/api/index.html) (generated by [vscaladoc](http://code.google.com/p/vscaladoc/)).
